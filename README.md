# Vapor Swift Tips

This is a compilation of all the good tips I'm gathering during my Vapor discovery journey. I'll try to regularly add more of them as I find them on websites, discord discussions or even the Vapor code itself. I'll also try to always add a reference pointing to the source of my tips so you can have an idea of where to look for more details.

I'll also try to define which version of Swift or Vapor is required for each tips:
