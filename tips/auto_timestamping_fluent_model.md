# How to auto-timestamp your Fluent models ![][image-1]

[back to index][1]

It is common to add timestamps in your database table schema like `createdAt` and `updatedAt` to track modifications in your data. But dealing with it each time you need to create a model or updating it, could be cumbersome.

Using **Vapor 3** and **Fluent**, this is very easy to add those fields and ask **Fluent** to automatically manage them for you! ðŸŽ‰

## Setup your model
Let's say you have a `Person` model like this:

```swift
struct Person: PostgreSQLModel {
	var id: Int?
	var firstName: String
	var lastName: String
}
```

Here is all you have to do to auto-timestamp it:

- First add the two timestamp properties:

```swift
struct Person: PostgreSQLModel {
	var id: Int?
	var firstName: String
	var lastName: String
	// Timestamp
	var createdAt: Date?
	var updatedAt: Date?
}
```

**Note:** you can name them differently if you prefer.

- Second, tell **Fluent** which one they are, using `keyPath` definition like below

```swift
extension Person {
	static let createdAtKey: TimestampKey? = \Person.createdAt
	static let updatedAtKey: TimestampKey? = \Person.updatedAt
}
```

## How to make it easier to manage?
If you start to have lots of models, it can quickly become tedious to add all these `keyPath` definitions which are always the same. And as you usually want to use the same names for these properties through out all your schemas, you can easily define a new protocol to ease the process.

So, let's introduce this new protocol that we can call `AutoTimestampable`! ðŸ¤“

```swift
import Fluent

protocol AutoTimestampable: Model {    
	var createdAt: Date? { get set }
	var updatedAt: Date? { get set }
}

extension AutoTimestampable {
	static var createdAtKey: TimestampKey? { return \Self.createdAt }
	static var updatedAtKey: TimestampKey? { return \Self.updatedAt }
}
```

**Note:** If you prefer, replace the timestamp properties in the protocol definition and in the returned value of each default `keyPath` implementations. For example, if you prefer naming them `creationDate` and `lastUpdateDate`, you'll get this instead:

```swift
import Fluent

protocol AutoTimestampable: Model {    
	var creationDate: Date? { get set }
	var lastUpdateDate: Date? { get set }
}

extension AutoTimestampable {
	static var createdAtKey: TimestampKey? { return \Self.creationDate }
	static var updatedAtKey: TimestampKey? { return \Self.lastUpdateDate }
}
```

**Tips:** Once you've added this, you can leverage **Xcode** fix-it to help you adding the missing pieces in each of your models. Simply add the `AutoTimestampable` protocol at the definition level (not in an extension) to have **Xcode** automatically adding the timestamp properties for you:

Once you see the error, click on it and hit the `Fix` button, or simply hit `Ctrl+Opt+Cmd+F`:

**Note:** if you prefer adding it in an extension, the fixit will create computed properties stubs instead since you can't add stored properties in extensions, which is probably not what you're expecting ðŸ™ˆ.

If you prefer this style of protocol conformance, you'll have to create the properties yourself in the main definition.
